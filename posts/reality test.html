<p>Illusions show that we do not see reality as it is. For example, patches A and B in the image below are of the same color (which means the photons arriving from these two patches are of the same wavelength).</p>
<p>You can verify that the colors in the two patches are exactly the same via a color picker app.  <strong>Yet our mind sees them as completely different colors</strong>. This clearly demonstrates that, at least in this case, we’re not seeing reality as it is.</p>

<p><em>say you visit a village in africa, and want to explain a child about “existence of Burj-Khalifa”. there is an added condition - you cannot use attributes of existing things the child knows.</em></p>
<p>without using building, tall, glass, skyscraper, dubai, you can never convey Burj-Khalifa to the child</p>
<p>this is an important concept that highlights, <strong>all new knowledge can only be understood if it fits within our existing mental models</strong></p>
<p>It’s turtles all the way down!</p>

-   Words are merely tags that point to shared experiences. The word "red" doesn't encode the actual experience of seeing red.
<p>Language is, hence at best, a low-resolution translator of reality.</p>
<h2 id="logic">Logic</h2>
<p>lets begin with a quote “logic isn’t supposed to tell us what is true, it is supposed to tell us what follows from what.”</p>
<ul>
<li>logic is transitive and causal, it shows how you link 2 or more chain of rules together</li>
<li>Logic essentially consists in a set of operations for deriving a statement from other statements. It brings nothing new to the table.</li>
<li>The conclusion merely flows from the premises as their inevitable consequence:
<ol>
<li>All birds have feathers. (Premise 1)</li>
<li>Woodpeckers are birds. (Premise 2)</li>
<li>Therefore, woodpeckers have feathers. (Conclusion)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>However the major problem with logic here is that it relies on premises that are founded, not on logic itself, but on inductive reasoning</li>
</ul>
<p>While powerful, logic is fundamentally a tool for deriving statements from other statements. It doesn’t generate new information but reveals what follows from our premises. Moreover, these premises often rely on inductive reasoning rather than pure logic.</p>
<h2 id="faith">Faith</h2>
<p>it’s like saying we have a problem, we need a variable X to solve it</p>
<p>just the above can be a big leap for many. here is an example.</p>
<p>when your math teacher says we need X to solve the equation:</p>
<ul>
<li>we don’t immediately ask what is X?</li>
<li>why do we need that?</li>
<li>you are just drawing a cross on the board, how will it help us?</li>
</ul>
<p>instead of asking these, we trust the teacher’s take, follow the math, and voila the problem is solved and X now has a value - the teacher was right!</p>
<p>We demand a similar openness here as we uncover truth.</p>
<p>Why do we need truth to exist, and why must it be unknown? These questions form the foundation of our epistemological journey. The concept of an unknown truth acts as a placeholder, much like a variable in mathematics. When a math teacher introduces ‘X’ to solve an equation, we don’t question its existence or purpose; we trust the process and follow along. Similarly, in our pursuit of knowledge, we must remain open to the possibility of an unknown truth that guides our inquiry.</p>
