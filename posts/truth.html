<p>ॐ पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात्पुर्णमुदच्यते<br>
पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ॥</p>
<p>“That is whole. This is whole. From wholeness comes wholeness.<br>
Taking wholeness from wholeness, wholeness remains.”</p>
<h2 id="the-nature-of-truth">The Nature of Truth</h2>
<p>Truth, in its purest form, is something that remains constant, regardless of our awareness or perception of it. It is an absolute that exists independently of our knowledge or beliefs.</p>
<p>Consider gravity, for instance.</p>
<p>The force of gravity continues to act upon us and everything around us, whether we understand its principles or not. It existed long before Newton formulated his laws, and it will continue to exist regardless of our comprehension.</p>
<h2 id="the-absolute-truth">The Absolute Truth</h2>
<p>In Advaita Vedanta philosophy, a similar principle applies to the nature of our true self.</p>
<p>The concept of “Brahman” – the ultimate, unchanging reality – is considered an absolute truth. According to this philosophy, you are Brahman, the ultimate reality, whether you are aware of it or not. Your true nature exists independently of your current state of knowledge or realization.</p>
<h2 id="why-cant-i-see-the-truth">Why can’t I see the truth?</h2>
<p>If the truth is already here, why do you still feel like a mortal?</p>
<p>To navigate this we need a quick primer on how perception works and we call upon the proverbial Vedantic snake!</p>
<p>Imagine walking in a dimly lit room and seeing what appears to be a snake.<br>

<p>Your heart races, you feel fear.</p>
<p>But upon closer inspection, you realize it’s merely a coiled rope. The rope was always there, but your perception overlaid the image of a snake onto it.</p>
<p>This allegory serves to demonstrate how our perceptions can cloud the truth of reality.</p>
<p>The knowledge of the rope dispells the false perception of the snake that was never there!</p>
<h2 id="knowledge-vs-realization">Knowledge vs Realization</h2>
<p>The journey to freedom, is about gaining knowledge to remove the fog of ignorance clouding us from the truth.</p>
<p>Knowledge of our true nature as Brahman is the first step. It’s like reading about the rope or hearing others describe it. This knowledge can bring comfort and a sense of peace. It can change our perspective and how we interact with the world.</p>
<p>Realization is he direct experience of our true nature as Brahman, it’s not just knowing about the rope, but directly experiencing its rope-ness.</p>
<p>This realization is what truly sets us free. It dissolves the illusion of separateness and reveals the underlying unity of all existence.</p>
<h2 id="the-paradox-of-truth">The Paradox of Truth</h2>
<p>In the end, whether you grasp these concepts or not, whether you experience realization or remain in the realm of intellectual knowledge, the truth remains unchanged. Just as gravity continues to operate whether you understand it or not, your true nature as Brahman persists regardless.</p>
<p>This unchanging nature of truth is both a comfort and a call to awakening. It means that enlightenment is not something to be achieved, but something thats is readily available this moment and just needs to be recognized!</p>
<p>In this light, enlightenment is both profoundly transformative and utterly natural – a return to what has always been, a recognition of the truth that has never changed.</p>
<p>Whether you get it or you don’t get it, the truth remains. The question is: are you ready to see it?</p>
